# Chandrayaan3_TDD_Incubyte
A c++ program that correctly displays final position and direction of chandrayaan spacecraft for given commands

The codebase for a programme that makes command translation possible is kept in this repository.

The galactic coordinates, which are represented by three-dimensional (x, y, and z) coordinates, direct Chandrayaan 3's path through the vastness of the galaxy. Its location in the galaxy is indicated by these coordinates:

x: Denotes the east-west position of the spacecraft.
y: Indicates the north-south position of the spacecraft.
z: Determines how far the spaceship is above or below the galactic plane using the letter z.

The spaceship may be moved forward or backward, turned left or right, and its orientation can be changed from up to down using these commands.

Key features: An easy-to-use command system that allows for precise spacecraft control.
Support for galactic coordinates in three dimensions.
Modularized and effective codebase for simple maintenance and improvements.
